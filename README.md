### Processed data files stored here (Github):

-   **Taxonomy** - analyses/taxonomy/\*.csv

    -   .csv files of OTU-level taxonomic classifications

        -   `taxonomy_table_combined.csv` contains the taxonomy table for the combined OTUs from the Survey and Experimental data

        -   `taxonomy_table_Survey.csv` contains the taxonomy table for the OTUs found in the Survey data

        -   `taxonomy_table_Exp.csv` contains the taxonomy table for the OTUs found in the Experimental data

    -   .csv files of computed taxa relative abundance across all taxonomic ranks for both Survey and Experimental data

        -   e.g., `RelAbundance_Survey_Global_mean_Phylum.csv` contains the relative abundance of OTUs agglomerated to the phylum level, summarized as the mean across all Survey samples ('global').
